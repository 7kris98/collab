## Steps involved in this machine learning project: Following are the steps involved in creating a well-defined ML project:

- Understand and define the problem
- Analyse and prepare the data
- Apply the algorithms
- Reduce the errors
- Predict the result

## These 2 steps need to be performed in the day4 workshop itself

## These 3 steps need to be performed in the day5 workshop
